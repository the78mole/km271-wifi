This piece of hardware is a direct replacement for the Buderus KM271 to control a buderus heating system with Logamatic 2107 controller board. Maybe other controllers are supported. Please file an issue (or better a PR) if you have my module running in other Buderus heating controllers, so I can add them here.

If you bought the board in my tindie store, you could find a how-to to get it running [here](https://the78mole.de/projects/km271-wifi-howto/)


This is a rendering of the board as it will arrive soon (Version 0.0.7):
![v0.0.6_SMD_Top mostly assembled](IMG/KM271-WiFi-0.0.7_3D.png)

This is the board as I shipped it lately (Version 0.0.6):
![v0.0.6_SMD_Top mostly assembled](IMG/PXL_20230317_192132690.jpg)

This is version 0.0.5:
![v0.0.5_SMD_Top fully assembled](IMG/KM271-WiFi_0.0.5_top_fully.jpg)

## Improvements / ToDo

 * Add a OneWire temperature Sensor on the board itself
 * Fix a minor bug with external I2C pull-up (tie them to PCA9306 selectable supply)

## Firmware Management

This project includes a comprehensive firmware management system for easy firmware updates and batch production:

### üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
cd FW
./setup-dev.sh                                    # Setup development environment
uv run scripts/flash_firmware.py                  # List available firmware
uv run scripts/flash_firmware.py blinkenlights    # Flash single device
```

### üì¶ Available Firmware Options

- **blinkenlights** - Local PlatformIO test project for hardware validation  
- **km271-esphome** - ESPHome-based KM271 WiFi replacement ([the78mole/ESPhome-KM271-WiFi](https://github.com/the78mole/ESPhome-KM271-WiFi))
- **dewenni-km271** - Feature-rich KM271 firmware ([dewenni/ESP_Buderus_KM271](https://github.com/dewenni/ESP_Buderus_KM271))

All firmware images are automatically downloaded and prepared for flashing using the management scripts.

### üè≠ Batch Production

For manufacturing multiple units:

```bash
uv run scripts/flash_firmware.py blinkenlights --loop
```

- Flash device ‚Üí Connect next device ‚Üí Press any key to continue
- Press 'n' to stop and show statistics
- Supports both ESC and 'n' for stopping

### üìñ Documentation

See [`FW/README.md`](FW/README.md) for detailed firmware management documentation, including:

- Setup instructions
- Script usage examples  
- Troubleshooting guide
- Batch production workflows
