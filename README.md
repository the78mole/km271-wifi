If you just received a module, you can find help with installation here:

  - [Getting Started Guide](DOC/Getting_Started.md)
  - [Erste Schritte](DOC/Erste_Schritte.md)

This piece of hardware is a direct replacement for the Buderus KM271 to control a buderus heating system with Logamatic 2107 controller board. Maybe other controllers are supported. Please file an issue (or better a PR) if you have my module running in other Buderus heating controllers, so I can add them here.

## Extensions

There is now an Extension to add wired Ethernet to the board. The prototype already works, availability in tindie store will still take some time...
